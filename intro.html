Imagine you just rolled a ball along the ground. Let's start the ball from some point
<em>A</em> at position=0, and call point <em>B</em> at position=1 the place where it ended up after 1 second.
                </p>
                <p>
When seen from above, the ball would trace out a straight line, advancing at a steady pace.

Above, this is depicted as 1-dimensional. This makes some sense, because the ball is
traveling in a line (1 spatial dimension). However, the scenario can also be thought of as
2-dimensional, with both space and time as dimensions.
            </p>
            <p>
This second interpretation is a bit harder to visualize. Instead of just looking at the
ball (point), let's draw a line describing the path of the ball from A to B. Just as before,
the ball should move from point A to point B, only now both points live in 2d-space, so there's
an extra dimension to keep track of.
            </p>
            <p>
In the below example, point A is at (time=0, space=0), and point B is at (time=1, space=1). You can also see the original diagram at the top for comparison.

Notice how the line from A to B runs at a perfect diagonal. This is because the units are very strange: a sneaky trick was used at the beginning, defining "1" in space to mean "the distance the ball travels in 1 second." Spacetime diagrams typically use a similar trick to solve an obvious issue of scaling.
            </p>
            <p>
            Imagine that instead of kicking a ball, you fired a photon of light parallel to the ground. How long would it take the light to travel one meter? Light travels at <span class="equation">c = ~3*10<sup>8</sup></span> meters per second. Since (distance) = (rate) * (time), <span class="equation">1 = t * 3*10<sup>8</sup></span>, so <span class="equation">t = 1/(3*10<sup>8</sup>)</span> = 0.00000000333 seconds. Obviously, this is not nice number to work with.
            </p>
            <p>
            Instead of using time (which could be measured in seconds or minutes), spacetime diagrams typically have a ct-axis (c is the speed of light). <span class="equation">(speed) * (time) = (distance)</span>, so the ct-axis is measured in units of distance (typically meters). This makes light movement very easy: light always moves 1 meter of space every meter of the ct-axis. In other words, on spacetime diagrams, light always moves along diagonal lines.
            </p>
            <p>
From here onwards, instead of "position" and "time", the more standard "x" and "ct" axis labels will be used. A sample spacetime diagram with two lightrays is shown below.

Lastly, let’s revisit points A and B. While these were called “points" earlier, the more technical name for them is “events." Events must always have both a location and a time associated with them. In the above example, event A happens at (time=0, location=0), while event B happens at (time=1, location=1). Unlike light rays, there are no restrictions on when/where events can be placed. Events are very important in spacetime diagrams.
